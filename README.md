# NOKIA-3310-snake-game

The popular sanke game which we all have played...

The project is totally based on the python OOPs, and consists of the objects for the snake body, the food and the score board.

Score is updated as the snake head comes in contact with the 'food dot' and the program takes the note of the final score every time, stores the final score and updates the high-score if the current score beats it. 

python's 'turtle' library was used here to create the visible objects, game window and to add functionalities.
